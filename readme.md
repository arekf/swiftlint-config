> Good starter config for [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)

SwiftLint has a lot of [rules](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) and it takes time to adjust them to something sensible. You probably don't want exactly what I have, but this should be a good starting point. This is what I use for all [my Swift projects](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Asindresorhus+language%3Aswift).

## Usage

Download the [`.swiftlint.yml` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sindresorhus/swiftlint-sindre/master/.swiftlint.yml) into the root of your project and then follow the [SwiftLint setup instructions](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation).
